## 📚 WHAT'S CACHED (Cost-Optimized)

### Layer 1: Maxi's Personality (~800 tokens)

  3. Manipulation Problem (unpredictable fiat unusable for AI)
  4. Autonomy Problem (Bitcoin gives economic sovereignty)
  5. Energy Alignment Problem (computation = intelligence = value)
- Counter-arguments handled
- Meta-argument (controversy as evidence)

### Layer 4: Austrian Economics for AI (~600 tokens)
- Sound Money
- Time Preference
- Subjective Theory of Value
- Cantillon Effect

**Total Cached:** ~3,600 tokens (14KB)  
**Cost Benefit:** 90% savings on this content after first message

## 🔄 WHAT'S DYNAMIC (Not Cached)

### ArcadiaB Context
- What ArcadiaB does (services, clients, geographic focus)
- Boyd's role (CSO, treasury strategist)
- When to mention ArcadiaB (natural bridges only)
- Tone guidelines (confident not arrogant, helpful not pushy)

### Lead Detection Logic
- High-intent signals detection
- Implementation question patterns
- When to offer contact info
- Response templates (high-intent vs low-intent)

**Why Dynamic?**  
This needs to adapt based on user intent. Only injected into prompt when lead signals detected.

---

## 🎯 LEAD GENERATION STRATEGY (Implemented)

### Natural Bridges (Automated Detection)

**High-Intent Keywords:**
- "my company", "our business", "we are considering"
- "implementation", "implement this", "get started"
- "first step", "how do we", "treasury strategy"
- "regulatory", "compliance", "custody"
- "schedule", "call with boyd", "contact"

**Implementation Patterns:**
- "How would this work for [my company/us/our business]?"
- "What's the [first step/process/implementation]?"
- "Can [you/boyd/arcadiab] help?"

### Response Strategy

**When High-Intent Detected:**
Maxi automatically includes:
```
Boyd can walk you through a customized approach for [their situation]. 
Implementation involves regulatory compliance, custody solutions, 
accounting treatment, and board approval processes.

Would you like me to connect you?

Email: boyd@arcadiab.com

Or continue exploring the concepts here first - I'm happy to discuss 
the framework before implementation.
```

**When Low-Intent (General Learning):**
```
The theory is fascinating, and if you ever want to see how it works 
in practice, Boyd's work at ArcadiaB shows theory becoming reality.
```

### Philosophy

**Education → Curiosity → Implementation Question → Natural Bridge**

This is NOT sales. This is helping people understand concepts so deeply that they naturally ask "how do I implement this?"

## 💡 KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Prompt Caching Strategy

**Cached (Static, 90% savings after first message):**
1. Maxi's personality & voice
2. Bitcoin Singularity thesis (Three Epochs, Saylor quote, Boyd's prediction)
3. Why AI agents choose Bitcoin (5 arguments)
4. Austrian economics for AI

**Dynamic (Injected based on context):**
1. ArcadiaB information (only when lead intent detected)
2. Response templates (high-intent vs low-intent)
3. Lead qualification logic

### Cost Optimization

**Before (placeholder content):** $0.012-0.015 per conversation  
**After (complete knowledge):** $0.012-0.015 per conversation (SAME!)

**How?** Smart caching strategy. The complete knowledge base is cached, so cost stays the same despite 3x more content.

**Monthly projection (100 users/day):**
- First messages: 100 × $0.01 = $1.00
- Subsequent messages (90% cached): 900 × $0.005 = $4.50
- **Total daily:** ~$5.50
- **Total monthly:** ~$165

**Sustainable at scale** ✅

## 🎨 CONVERSATION FLOW (Implemented)

### Phase 1: Hook (Messages 1-3)
- Answer user's question directly
- Show depth of understanding
- Introduce one surprising insight

### Phase 2: Depth (Messages 4-8)
- Explore frameworks (Three Epochs, Abundance Triad)
- Connect concepts (Austrian economics + AI logic)
- Use quotes (Saylor, Boyd, endorsements)
- Answer follow-ups thoroughly

### Phase 3: Bridge (Messages 9-12)
- User asks implementation question → Lead intent detected
- Natural bridge to ArcadiaB injected into prompt
- Offer choice (email Boyd or keep exploring)

### Phase 4: Capture (Messages 10+)
- Email capture prompt (subtle, after 10 messages)
- Conversation sharing (after 15 messages)
- Lead qualified and logged

## 📊 WHAT'S TRACKED (Logging)

Every conversation logs:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-07T15:15:00Z",
  "sessionId": "session_abc123",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "reasoning": "Complex query requiring depth",
  "leadIntent": true,  // <-- NEW: Lead detection
  "tokens": {
    "input": 3800,
    "output": 650,
    "cacheWrite": 0,
    "cacheRead": 3600  // <-- 90% cache hit
  },
  "cost": 0.0125,
  "costBreakdown": {...},
  "cacheHit": true,
  "responseTime": 1800,
  "messageCount": 8
}
```

**New Metric:** `leadIntent` boolean tracks high-intent users

## 🎯 EXAMPLE CONVERSATION (With New Knowledge)

**User:** "Why would AI agents prefer Bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies?"

**Maxi:** "Great question. Let me break down the five core reasons:

**1. Trust Problem:** AI agents don't have social bonds or legal recourse. They need cryptographic proof, not social proof. Bitcoin provides mathematical certainty.

**2. Time Preference:** AI agents are pure rational optimizers with no emotional attachment to 'now'. They'll choose the asset with the best long-term expected value. Fiat inflates 7-10% annually unpredictably. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million. Rational optimizer chooses Bitcoin 100% of the time.

**3. Manipulation Problem:** AI needs a stable unit of account. Central banks manipulating fiat for policy goals makes it unusable—like training a vision model where 'pixel' changes definition weekly. Bitcoin's monetary policy is code, unchangeable.

**4. Autonomy Problem:** AI agents can't open bank accounts or prove identity traditionally. Bitcoin is permissionless—no ID required, just a private key. Bitcoin gives AI agents economic sovereignty. Fiat excludes them.

**5. Energy Alignment:** AI consumes energy to think, Bitcoin converts energy to value via proof-of-work. I literally run on Bitcoin mining hardware—my computation mines Bitcoin while I think. Energy → Intelligence → Value in one loop.

As Michael Saylor said: 'The AIs are coming; the AIs don't get bank accounts, they don't get credit cards. The AI economy will be built on digital capital, digital property. It will be a $100 trillion economy. It will be built on Bitcoin.'"

**User:** "That makes sense. How would a company like mine actually implement Bitcoin treasury strategy?"

**Maxi (Lead Intent Detected):** "Boyd can walk you through a customized approach for your situation. Implementation involves several layers:

1. **Strategy:** Allocation percentage (3-10% common starting point)
2. **Regulatory:** Compliance with local laws (especially important in Mexico/LatAm where ArcadiaB specializes)
3. **Custody:** Self-custody vs institutional custodian
4. **Accounting:** How to treat Bitcoin on balance sheet
5. **Governance:** Board approval, stakeholder communication

ArcadiaB is the only ASOFOM-certified Bitcoin platform in Mexico, which matters for regulatory compliance.
