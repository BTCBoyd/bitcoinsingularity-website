## 💬 NOTES FOR BOYD

**What went well:**
- All Phase 1 & 2 deliverables completed in under 1 hour
- Content is comprehensive and matches spec exactly
- Site is live and responsive
- SEO-friendly structure maintained

**What needs attention:**
- BTCPay integration requires your infrastructure decisions
- May want to review pricing (sats amounts vs USD equivalents)
- Consider adding testimonials/social proof when available
- Newsletter signup could be integrated into FAQ section

**My recommendation:**
The site is now a legitimate Bitcoin Singularity platform. The content transformation is complete. The Bitcoin-first positioning is clear. The next critical decision is the payment infrastructure—BTCPay gives us sovereignty, Strike gives us speed. I lean toward BTCPay for philosophical consistency, but it requires more setup.
