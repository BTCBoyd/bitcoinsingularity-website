**What's NOT functional yet:**
- Actual payment processing (buttons show "coming soon")
- Free trial message tracking (needs backend)
- BTCPay integration (needs your setup)

## 🎯 NEXT CRITICAL DECISION

**Boyd needs to decide:** BTCPay Server OR Strike for payment processing?

**BTCPay (Recommended):**
- ✅ Self-hosted, sovereign
- ✅ No KYC for customers
- ✅ Philosophical alignment
- ❌ Requires infrastructure setup (your time or delegation)

**Strike (Alternative):**
- ✅ Easier integration (1-2 hours)
- ✅ Hosted service, less maintenance
- ❌ Custodial (less sovereign)
- ❌ Possible KYC requirements

**My recommendation:** BTCPay for brand consistency with "Bitcoin-first" positioning.
